add documentation about the tests

why is there no affienTransform
sse optimization of perspectiveTransform

Build:
- no default build of tutorials
- no default build of tests
- split the tests (db tests should at least be separated)
- make Factories depend on an ABC

Interface:
- --all should also have a --missing. Fix missing, object_names
- meshing should support --all, --missing, --object_ids
- autogeneration of parameter files:autogenerate if it does not exist
- normalize source parameters.  training and detection use a config file, everything else uses args...
- create a simple graph plasm viewer for ORK
- get the ecto_gooey to work with ORK

Performance:
- Mike's stuff

DB:
- move to a system dependency with python-couchdb after Electric (dropping Lucid support)
- delete things from the DB, find orphans, find missing components (models ...), find duplicates
- better object representation (model, inline images, 3d models ...)
  - HTML - see the model_viewer under apps. Its a couch app, we can make it do whatever.
           Currently have something for viewing the meshes, and something for viewing the objects.
- be able to only replicate models in a DB (to put on the PR2)
- add meta data that is missing (meet with everybody). We want: timestamp of the session, the sensor id
- use a single view for all model types
- is models.py obsolete?
- fix meshing so that it uses current db interface
- make more db manipulation scripts apps/dbscripts ... FIXME don't break these.

Capture:
- GUI for capturing obejcts on a dot pattern: the current box is hacky
- upload through the capture GUI. Also have the triggering of all the other models (RabbitMQ ...)
- should be a parameter file for the type of fiducials
- unify the different Kinect calls to use the Kinect source (grep for /camera/depth)

Doc:
- API docs
- autogeneration of config files
- write docs for ecto_gooey

New cells:
- masks, filters
- Mike's stuff

Test:
- have something for performance. Use NIST.
- ground truth format?  Look at NIST CSV.  Possibly come up with bag format too, where each frame has a listing of object id and pose relative to the sensor
- ground truth capture... Use the NIST Ponoko rig to capture scenes with GT poses. Needs a simple app or something.
- fix tests in /test that are unused
















(ROS) logging everything happening between the Python launch and when the plasm starts
more unittests on config file/command line arguments
the automatic docs should use the parameters from the cell only, and have a function to overload
doc_config belongs to python_or_core


document what a submethod is in ORK
add default DB parameters to the config_doc

make sure you can parametrize topics in soruce (for PR2 and:
/head_mount_kinect/rgb/image_color
/head_mount_kinect/rgb/camera_info
/head_mount_kinect/depth/camera_info
/head_mount_kinect/depth/image
)
